    <p>
        I am Audrey Fernandez and I have been working in Visual Communications for over 22 years. After taking classes at the University of California, Irvine as part of the Graphic Design and Visual Communications Program, I became the Creative Director for a fairly large manufacturing company in Santa Ana. Over the years I've worked as a Creative Director, Art Director, Production Artist, Freelance Graphic Designer, and Web Designer. As a result, I have acquired valuable skills and knowledge in every aspect of the design and printing process.Â

        While my experience in graphic design has been rewarding, I have come to realize that web development has progressed far beyond my skill-set as a designer. To remedy this, I am once again attending classes at UCI but this time as part of the Coding Boot Camp program. From what I understand, a full-stack developer is a rarity in the web development industry. My goal is to become a true Unicornin the industry by not only offering the sought after skills of a full-stack developer, but also the background of an experienced designer.
