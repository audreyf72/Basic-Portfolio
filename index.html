    <p>My name is Audrey Fernandez and I have been working as a Graphic Artist in Orange County, California for over 22 years. I have an extensive background in all areas of graphic design, especially in offset and direct screen printing. Due to the wide spread shift from print to web based mediums, I have shifted my focus to web design and development utilizing HTML and CSS.
    <br>
    I started my career after taking classes in 1995 at the University of California, Irvine as part of the Graphic Design and Visual Communications Program. Over the years I've worked as an Art Director, Creative Director, Production Artist, Graphic Designer, and Web Designer. As a result, I have acquired valuable skills and knowledge in every aspect of the design and printing process, from concept to completion.Â While my experience in graphic design has been rewarding, I have come to realize that web development has progressed far beyond my skill-set as a designer. To remedy this, I am once again attending classes at UCI but this time as part of the Coding Boot Camp program. 
    <br>
    My goal is to become a unicorn in the web development community; An experienced and talented visual artist with the skills of a full stack developer. I'm excited to see the things I can come up with once I've mastered the art of coding.
